This simple app is created to solve sleep mode problem with JBL Bluetooth speakers via AUX connection on windows pc.

Core problem is in SBC audio codec (only) which uses in old models - sound quality is horrible. 

So you should preffer to connect via aux to your pc driven dac. But. In case you stop send any signal
at least 5-10 mins - speaker is going to sleep mode. And thats all. You have no chance to wake them up 
even if you send high signal via aux.

This app sends a little sound portion via bluetooth to speaker - kick them ass -  to wake up, if enough 
time has passed
